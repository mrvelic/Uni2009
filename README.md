Terrible things from Uni in 2009

Super Running Man
-------
Command prompt based game where you shoot unicode happy faces. 
Intro to game programming assignment 1.

Pop Showdown
-------
Unfinished mostly broken game where pop stars are angry and you shoot them.
Intro to game programming assignment 2.

Written from scratch in ~2 weeks, so it's mostly broken gameplay wise (had no time to make proper assets)
